# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

ME 2801 — Controls Engineering course materials. Content includes MATLAB live scripts, LaTeX exam/homework documents, reusable MATLAB utilities, and USV (Unmanned Surface Vehicle) lab materials for system identification.

## Repository layout (three-repo umbrella)

This repo is one of three siblings that travel together. The canonical layout is an **umbrella directory** containing all three as siblings:

```
<umbrella>/                                      # any name; e.g. me2801/
  me2801/           # public — this repo
  me2801-private/   # instructor-only
  me2801-claude/    # Claude session history + memory
```

- **Public:** `bsb808/me2801` — the directory you're reading.
- **Private:** `bsb808/me2801-private` — sibling at `../me2801-private/`. Holds instructor-only content (oral-exam reminders, internal notes, working drafts not ready to publish, anything inappropriate for a public course repo).
- **Claude session history:** `bsb808/me2801-claude` — sibling at `../me2801-claude/`. Holds session `.jsonl` logs and the persistent `memory/` directory.
- The private tree **mirrors** the public structure: `../me2801-private/book/wXX_*/notes/oral_exam_questions.md` corresponds to public `book/wXX_*/notes/`.
- Each repo has its own git history. Use the root `Makefile` for coordinated git ops (`make status-all`, `make pull-all`, `make push-all`, `make sync-all`) or operate on each repo individually.

### Why the umbrella matters

Claude Code is launched from the umbrella directory, *not* from this public repo. That means:

- `pwd` is the umbrella; `./` paths in this file refer to the umbrella, not the public repo.
- Claude's session/memory directory is `~/.claude/projects/<umbrella-path-with-/-as->/` (the slug is the absolute umbrella path with `/` replaced by `-`). The `-claude` repo is symlinked there so all session writes are version-controlled.
- All three repos are reachable as `./<repo-name>/` from the umbrella, or as `../<sibling>/` from inside any one of them.

### When to route content to private

During any review or note-taking workflow (including the `% CLAUDE:` PMR review process), if the user marks something as private — e.g. "this is a private note", "save as private", "remind me privately", or asks for content that's clearly for personal study (oral exam prep, gripes about colleagues, draft material the user isn't ready to publish) — write it to `../me2801-private/` mirroring the public file's location. Do **not** put it in the public file.

If a public file would benefit from referencing a private note, prefer **omitting the link** rather than embedding a path that breaks for anyone cloning only the public repo. The user knows where to find their private notes.

If the user has not yet cloned the private repo on this machine (no `../me2801-private/.git` directory), tell them how to clone it (`make clone-private` from this repo) before writing private content. Do not silently create files into a non-git-tracked directory thinking they're being saved.

### Session pickup notes

If `../me2801-private/SESSION_NOTES.md` exists, read it at the start of every session. It contains the user's hand-off context — what they were working on last session, where to resume, any pending decisions. The user maintains it themselves; you can also update it when stopping work, if the user asks. It is **not** a substitute for the public CLAUDE.md guidance above; treat it as supplementary state for the active session.

### Repo plumbing

A `Makefile` at the root of this public repo coordinates all three repos. Prefer `make pull-all` / `make push-all` / `make sync-all` / `make status-all` over running `git` three times manually. One-time-per-machine setup targets:

- `make clone-private` — clones the private sibling next to this repo
- `make clone-claude` — clones the `-claude` sibling next to this repo
- `make link-claude` — creates the `~/.claude/projects/...` symlink into the `-claude` repo (so session writes are version-controlled)
- `make doctor` — checks layout invariants on a new machine (siblings present, symlink in place, etc.)

## Plain-Text Live Script Format (.m files)

Live scripts in this repo use MATLAB's plain-text format (`.m` with special markers), **not** binary `.mlx`. The `.gitattributes` marks `.mlx` as binary — do not create or edit `.mlx` files.

### Markers

| Marker | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `%[text] prose here` | Prose cell (Markdown and LaTeX math supported) |
| `%%` | Section break / runnable cell boundary |
| Plain MATLAB code | No marker needed |

### Spacing rules (parser is sensitive to these)

- **No blank line** between a `%[text]` block and the code that follows it
- **No blank line** before a `%%` section break
- Blank paragraph within prose: use `%[text] ` (trailing space) — not an empty `%[text]` line and not `\`
- Blank lines *within* a code block are fine

### LaTeX math in prose cells

Only **inline math** `$...$` is supported — `$$...$$` display math is **not** recognized and renders as plain text.  For equations that should appear on their own line, put the `$...$` on a dedicated `%[text]` line.

**Backslashes must be doubled** in the source file: `\\frac`, `\\tau`, `\\left`, `\\right`, etc.  MATLAB's parser unescapes `\\` → `\` before handing the string to the LaTeX renderer.

**Underscores in subscripts must be escaped**: `K\_{DC}`, `y\_{\\mathrm{LPF}}`.  A bare `_` is interpreted as Markdown italic markup and breaks the subscript.

Do not use AMS-math extensions (`\boxed`, `\begin{align}`, `\begin{equation}`) — they are not supported.  `\Longleftrightarrow`, `\qquad`, `\mathrm`, `\mathbf`, `\left`/`\right` all work.

### Required footer

Every `.m` live script must end with this exact block or MATLAB opens it as a plain script:

```matlab
%[appendix]{"version":"1.0"}
%---
%[metadata:view]
%   data: {"layout":"inline"}
%---
```

`"layout":"onright"` is also valid (output panel docked to the right). Do not regenerate or modify `%[output:HASH]` blocks — those are auto-generated by MATLAB.

If MATLAB opens a live script as a plain script despite the footer, right-click the file and choose **Open as Live Script**.

## USV Lab Data Pipeline

ArduPilot `.BIN` logs are processed in two stages before system identification:

**Stage 1 — Binary to MAT**
```bash
python utils/ardu_utils/bin2mat.py <logfile.BIN>
# Output: <logfile.BIN>.mat
```
Fields are named `{MSGTYPE}_{field}` (e.g., `GPS_Spd`, `RCOU_C3`, `IMU_GyrZ`). All timestamps are Unix/POSIX time (seconds since epoch).

**Stage 2 — Extract and save relevant fields**

`book/w03_lab_usv_sysid/code/proc_openloop_response.m` loads the `.BIN.mat`, plots surge and yaw step responses for visual inspection, then saves a trimmed `.BIN.proc.mat` containing only the fields needed for sysid.

**Stage 3 — System identification**

`book/w03_lab_usv_sysid/code/lab1_sysid_proto.m` loads the `.proc.mat` and performs identification.

### Key signals

| Channel | Variable | Units | Role |
|---------|----------|-------|------|
| `RCOU_C3` | Throttle command | PWM (1000–2000) | Surge input |
| `GPS_Spd` | Ground speed | m/s | Surge output |
| `RCOU_C1` | Rudder command | PWM (1000–2000) | Yaw input |
| `IMU_GyrZ` | Yaw rate | rad/s | Yaw output |

### PWM scaling convention

All actuator inputs are scaled to **normalized effort (±1 fraction)** — not percent, not 0–1. Scaling is piecewise to handle asymmetric PWM ranges:

```matlab
inzero = 1500;  % PWM value for zero effort (neutral)
inmax  = 1900;  % PWM value for +1.0 effort
inmin  = 1100;  % PWM value for -1.0 effort

in_y_norm = zeros(size(in_y_step));
pos = in_y_step >= inzero;
in_y_norm( pos) = (in_y_step( pos) - inzero) / (inmax - inzero);
in_y_norm(~pos) = (in_y_step(~pos) - inzero) / (inzero - inmin);
```

`inzero`/`inmax`/`inmin` are vehicle-specific and come from the ArduPilot `.params` file (e.g. `RC3_MAX`, `RC3_MIN` for throttle; `RC1_MAX`, `RC1_MIN` for rudder). Do not use a unidirectional formula `(pwm - inmin)/(inmax - inmin)` — that was incorrect.

### Converting timestamps

```matlab
% Human-readable datetime
t_dt = datetime(t_unix, 'ConvertFrom', 'posixtime', 'TimeZone', 'UTC');

% Elapsed seconds (often clearer for step-response plots)
t_rel = t_unix - t_unix(1);
```

## Reusable MATLAB Utilities (`matlab/`)

- `sketchbode.m` — straight-line Bode approximation overlaid on the exact Bode plot; call `sketchbode(sys)`
- `BodePaper.m` — generates blank Bode paper for sketching
- `sketchbode_example1.m`, `bodepaper_ex.m` — usage examples for the above

These utilities must be on the MATLAB path when running scripts that call them.

## MATLAB Figures for LaTeX Documents

### Export format

Use **vector PDF** via `exportgraphics` (R2020a+):

```matlab
exportgraphics(fig, fullfile('images', [name '.pdf']), 'ContentType', 'vector')
```

Include in LaTeX with the explicit extension to avoid ambiguity if both `.pdf` and `.png` exist:

```latex
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/figname.pdf}
```

### Renderer and line width

- Do **not** set an explicit `LineWidth` on plot calls — MATLAB's default (0.5 pt) exports cleanly.  Values like 1.4 or even 1.0 can cause visible gaps in curves when exported.
- Do **not** set `'Renderer','painters'` on the figure or pass `-painters`/`-vector` to `print` — these interact poorly with transparent patches (`FaceAlpha`) and cause lines to drop out.  `exportgraphics` with `'ContentType','vector'` handles renderer selection correctly on its own.

### Legend text interpreter

Use `'Interpreter','tex'` (not `'latex'`) for legends:

```matlab
legend('Interpreter', 'tex', 'FontSize', LFS)
```

MATLAB's LaTeX renderer miscalculates legend bounding boxes for expressions containing `\;`, subscripts, and multi-token math, causing text to overflow the legend box in the exported PDF.  The `tex` interpreter sizes boxes correctly.  Subscripts still work: `e_{ss}`, `K_P`, `K_I`.

Axis labels and titles may still use `'Interpreter','latex'` — they are not affected by the bounding-box bug.

### PNG alternative

PNG export (`print -dpng -r300`) produces unreliable lines regardless of renderer flags and should be avoided for line plots destined for LaTeX.

## LaTeX

Exam and homework documents use standard LaTeX. Build with:

```bash
pdflatex <file>.tex
# or for full bibliography/cross-reference resolution:
latexmk -pdf <file>.tex
```

Build artifacts (`.aux`, `.log`, `.fls`, etc.) are gitignored. The `latex/equations/generate_eqn_images.sh` script renders individual equations as images.
